# VW-door-lock-parts
A replacement insert and tool for some VW door lock parts circa 1990s-2000s.

A selection of VAG cars from VW, SEAT, and Skoda including my VW Polo 6N from the early 1990s through the 2000s have a door lock with die-cast parts including an insert that fails. This contains my CAD work on fixing my locks. Currently the insert that broke on mine, and a tool to aid compressing the spring.

3D printing the insert on an FDM printer in PLA is unlikelyt to be strong enough for sustained use. Try ABS or nylon? But this might help someone whose door lock has brokenm while they wait for the replacement part to arrive.
